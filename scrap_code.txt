Scrap of code not used:

First, let's look at how many (i.e. frequency) of each type of events occur by building a histogram.

```{r echo=TRUE}

noaa_events_hist <- ggplot(noaa_data, aes(EVTYPE)) +
  geom_histogram(col="blue") +
  xlab("Events") +
  labs(title="Frequency of each event type") +
  theme_bw()

print(noaa_events_hist)

```
